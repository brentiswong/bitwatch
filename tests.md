- clean tests by deleting server/data/db.json
- load telegram bot page
  - configure fake telegram bot
  - save config
- load Address page
  - add collection, give it a name and save it
    - add single address to collection
      - see loading state on chain and mempool
      - then get event from socket that there is a balance change (the mock mempool api will send this event shortly after a new address is added)
      - see balance change on chain and mempool in UI
      - get an alert of balance change on mock telegram bot
      - accept balance change with accept button
      - see balance is confirmed
      - delete address (collection should remain)
    - add extended key to collection repeat this 3 times (xpub, ypub, zpub)
      - give it a name, set derivation path, set skip to 2, gap to 3, initial addresses to 3
      - see addresses loading in UI as they are generated
      - see values on chain and mempool in UI
      - get an alert of balance change on mock telegram bot
      - accept balance change with accept button
      - see balance is confirmed
      - delete extended key (collection should remain)
    - add descriptor to collection (for each descriptor type in test keys.json)
      - verify the same behaviors as extended key sets
